# VirtualHub DOSBox-X

Welcome to VirtualHub DOSBox-X! Here we will install old software on [DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/) directly.

On the main [VirtualHub](https://www.virtualhub.eu.org) website, we install old software on old operating systems installed on Virtual Machines on emulators. But it is much easier and more convenient to install the old software directly on DOSBox-X.

I know that you can also use DOSBox but I find DOSBox-X nor convenient and feature-rich, so I am going to use it.

Stay tuned!
