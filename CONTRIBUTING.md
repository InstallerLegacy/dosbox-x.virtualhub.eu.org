# How to contribute to VirtualHub DOSBox-X?

First of all, thank you for showing your interest in contributing
to the VirtualHub DOSBox-X website. If you contribute to this
project, you contribute to the large effort of conserving old
software.

VirtualHub DOSBox-X is a continuous project. Its goal is to provide
instructions for installing old software on DOSBox-X.

I will probably create most of the tutorials here myself in
the order of their release, but you may want to see a tutorial
sooner or I may have forgotten the software. In that case, you may
use
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/InstallerLegacy/dosbox-x.virtualhub.eu.org/issues) 
to ask for a specific tutorial.

You may want to report errors in the existing tutorials.
You can use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/InstallerLegacy/dosbox-x.virtualhub.eu.org/issues)
for that also. If you know enough about Hugo to make an edit
yourself then you are welcome to fork, make the edit, and open
a pull request.

If you have enough knowledge of Hugo and installing old 
Software on DOSBox-X, you can contribute a tutorial by creating a pull
request. You will be given appropriate credits. If you have any
questions, you can contact me at
[contact@virtualhub.eu.org](mailto:contact@virtualhub.eu.org).

Thank You once again for showing interest in this project.
