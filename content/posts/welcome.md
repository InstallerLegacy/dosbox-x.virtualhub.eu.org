Welcome to VirtualHub DOSBox-X! Here we will install old software on DOSBox-X directly.

On the main VirtualHub website, we install old software on old operating systems installed on VirtualMachines on emulators. But it is much easier and more convinient to install the old software directly on DOSBox-X.

I know that you can also use DOSBox but I find DOSBox-X mor convinient and feature-rich, so I am going to use it.

Stay tuned!
